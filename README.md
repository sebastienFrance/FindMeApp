# FindMeApp

FindMe is a simple iPhone App to find a place based on 3 locations and distances. Just done for fun with a friend!

## Some explanations

You can place on the Map 3 locations, they are configured with a default distance range (100km). Next the App finds automatically the place that is
at the nearest distance from each location (it's displayed on the Map with the star annotation).

If you are not happy with the position of the locations on the map, you can drag them anywhere (long press on the annotation and then you
can move it).

Annotations with the triangle show the triangle points used to compute the center place.

In the detailed view, you can change the distance range from any locations and you can also completely reset the configuration.
